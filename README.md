# VSME Template Migration Tool

The VSME Template Migration Tool automates the migration of data filled in older versions of the VSME Digital Template (Excel-based) into the latest template version.
It ensures that all Named Ranges (NRs) and data cells with missing ranges are transferred correctly and consistently between template versions — minimizing manual effort and the risk of errors during updates.

## Key Features
- Automatic version detection of the old template
- Checks for proper template fill before processing
- Transfers all user-entered data from the old template to the new one
- Handles renamed NRs and the non-referenced data cells
- Saves a new .xlsx ("result_from_1.*.*.xlsx") file ready for use with the latest VSME Digital Template

## Requirements
1. Python environment and dependencies:
   - openpyxl: Read/write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files
   - https://pandas.pydata.org/ : open source data analysis and manipulation tool
2. Filled-out Excel template with unmodified name ranges (see [digital templates](https://github.com/EFRAG-EU/Digital-Template-to-XBRL-Converter/tree/main/digital-templates))

## Notes & Warnings
The tool does not alter your original file — it creates a new copy.
If the selected workbook is not recognized as a valid VSME template, the script exits safely with a warning.
Some formatting (like checkboxes and arrows to navigate tabs) are not transferred.
